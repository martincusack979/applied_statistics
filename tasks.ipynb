    "***Task Description***:  Suppose we alter the Lady Tasting Tea experiment to involve twelve cups of tea. Six have the milk in first and the other six having tea in first. A person claims they have the special power of being able to tell whether the tea or the milk went into a cup first upon tasting it. You agree to accept their claim if they can tell which of the six cups in your experiment had the milk in first.\n",

    "Suppose, now, you are willing to accept one error. Once they select the six cups they think had the milk in first, you will give them the benefit of the doubt should they have selected at least five of the correct cups. Calculate the probability, assuming they have no special powers, that the person makes at most one error.\n",

    "***Task Solution:*** This question, based on Ronald Fisher's famous Lady Tasting Tea experiment, requires us firstly to figure out how many different ways there are of selecting 6 choices from a group of 12 (i.e. the number of different combinations of size 6) and then to calculate the probability of someone correctly identifying the 6 cups which had milk in first from a group of 12 cups. We can achieve this by importing and using Python's math.comb () method.\n",
