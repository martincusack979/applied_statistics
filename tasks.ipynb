A person claims they have the special power of being able to tell whether the tea or the milk went into a cup first upon tasting it. You agree to accept their claim if they can tell which of the six cups in your experiment had the milk in first.\n",

Once they select the six cups they think had the milk in first, you will give them the benefit of the doubt should they have selected at least five of the correct cups.

    "***Task Solution:*** This task, based on Ronald Fisher's famous Lady Tasting Tea experiment, requires us firstly to figure out how many different ways there are of selecting 6 choices from a group of 12 (i.e. the number of different combinations of size 6) and then to calculate the probability of someone correctly identifying the 6 cups which had milk in first from a group of 12 cups. We can do this by importing and using Python's math.comb () method (also known as the choose function).\n",

After running the ANOVA test multiple times, instead of repeatedly getting a result of zero, I now get results more in the range of 100 to 200. This is due to the fact that the much smaller sample size has diluted the sensitivity of the test. The smaller the sample size, the harder it is to avoid Type 2 errors.\n",
